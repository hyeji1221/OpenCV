# Real-time object detection with deep learning and OpenCV

이전 튜토리얼 (**Object detection with deep learning and OpenCV**) + apply real-time object detection using deep learning and OpenCV to work with video streams and video files

### Object detection in video with deep learning and OpenCV

**OpenCV로 딥러닝 실시간 기반 Object detector 구축하기**

1. access our webcam/video stream in an efficient manner
2. apply object detection to each frame.

### Summary

The end result is a deep learning-based object detector that can process approximately 6-8 FPS (depending on the speed of your system, of course).
